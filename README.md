Dashboard for Economy indicators (US Only)

1. LEADING INDICATORS - spot checks of business activity that reliably predict trends in the economy. Positive changes in these indicators predict economic improvement. Negative changes predict economic contraction.

2. COINCIDENT INDICATORS - Leading indicators reflect where the economy is going; coincident indicators confirm where it is. Coincident indicators are those measurable factors that vary directly and simultaneously with the business cycle.
